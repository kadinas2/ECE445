Worked on the proposal, looking into designing the power systems. So far we're working with two ESP32-S3's for their WiFi availability. As per the [documentation](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf) for the ESP32-S3 it recommends a 1A power source at 3.3V with + or - 100 mV accuracy. The Raspberry Pi recommended [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/) suggest using a 5.1V power supply with the same + or - 100mV accuracy, and a suggested 3.5A available current supply. This is likely higher than what we will use, as we're only using the the RasPi for computational work with OpenCV as well as for . We're going to estimate a total maximum instantaneous current draw of

Proposal meeting date, we met with Professor Gruev and he mentioned how we should consider filtering for the servo motors, as well as the high current and power draw. He discussed with us that even with linear regulators and buck converters, it's still possible for the motors to cause brown outs on the battery, which could affect the available power for our other onboard electronics. Still need to look into figuring out a 12V power system

I started working on fleshing out the power systems a little bit more. The only other issues I'll face is likely going to be with peripheral designs with buttons as well as figuring out how to flash the ESP32 controller via MicroUSB, since MicroUSB is available out of the TA order form. After searching for a while, I'm looking to focus on the [TPS565201DDCR](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps565201.pdf?HQS=dis-dk-null-digikeymode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1741532364837) and [TPS562201DDCR](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps562201.pdf?HQS=dis-dk-null-digikeymode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1746641732830&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fgeneral%252Fdocs%252Fsuppproductinfo.tsp%253FdistId%253D10%2526gotoUrl%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Flit%252Fgpn%252Ftps562201) adjustable Buck converter ICs, capable of delivering 5A and 2A respectively. These ICs are fairly cheap at around 35 cents per, so they work very well with our specifications The documentation has recommended design PCB design suggestions, and suggests an overall 60-70mV noise at the switching frequency. I'm looking to get an initial power design finished, so Henry Thomas and I can start working on developing initial PCBs. I also plan to order the two buck ICs for the breadboard demos, as well as look into figuring out how to integrate the Stepper motors.  

We also talked with the machine shop, and they recommended switching to servo motors. It would be easier to integrate the design together with the components they have, and reduce out power requirements. They also suggested that while we would lose some of the availability in degrees of freedom, we would gain back in easier control resources and easier angular accuracy.
  
We will be moving forward with a 7.4V battery, and step down to 5V and then to 3.3V, this makes it more efficient for our design, and will save us some of the additional challenges of designing a buck-boost converter. In this case the 7.4V battery is cheaper than finding a 3.7V as we want a high current capacity. Estimating worst case efficiencies with the power consumption of the ESP32 and 3A at 5V for both the motors and RasPi. This puts us at (3.3V/7.4V * 3.3V * 1A) + (5V/7.4V * 5V * 3A) = 13.88 W of power required. This would require a 1.875A battery require
