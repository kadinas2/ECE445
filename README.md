# Smart Tripod

The goal of this project was to develop a smart tripod capable of both manual and automated tracking, featuring motorized movement for zenith and azimuth angles. The tripod features a handheld controller that sports a small LCD screen that shows real-time feedback of the phone's display via AirPlay.

## Final design
